# AUTOMATED-TRAFFIC-LIGHT-MANAGEMENT-SYSTEM-PROJECT
This repository hosts the source code, schematics, and documentation for an Automated Traffic Light Management System using a Raspberry Pi 4, cameras with OpenCV/YOLOv5-nano, and LED-based traffic lights, it dynamically adjusts timings based on toy car simulations of vehicle density to optimize traffic flow.
